## Full deployment in the blink of an eye

## Description:
> UMS-CD is a server deployment system under debian scalable in number of machines and compatible with multiple sites.
> 
> UMS-CD integrates Proxmox and Docker as the main cloud platform and a list of tools to manage your infrastructure entirely in the browser through a bastion.

## Aventages:
### Upscalable:
> It is a scalable infrastructure because you can install new servers at any time.

### Multi Site Secure:
> You can have your servers on different sites in a secure way because the infra is entirely under Wireguard.

### Multi Service:
> The infra works in a 100% containerized or/and virtualized way, which allows you to multiply the services at will.

## Tools:
### UMS Central Panel:
> It is a centralization panel of the other interfaces of the infra adapted in the form of tabs and grids.

### UMS Template Repo:
> It is a repo containing several preconfigured LXC containers with different services such as Pterodactyl or Nextcloud.

### Front / Back Server Network:
> The infra network is designed so that the front servers are your routers and the backs your machines, because you can't necessarily touch the network.
